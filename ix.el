;;; ix.el --- Emacs client for http://ix.io pastebin

;; Copyright Â© 2013  Abhishek L

;; URL: http://www.github.com/theanalyst/ix.el
;; Version: 0.6.1
;; Package-Requires: ((grapnel "0.5.3"))

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; ix.el is a simple emacs client to http://ix.io cmdline pastebin. At
;; the moment using the `ix' command on a selection sends the
;; selection to ix.io, entire buffer is sent if selection is inactive,
;; on success the url is notified in the minibuffer as well as saved
;; in the kill ring.
;;
;; It is recommended to set a user name and token so that you can
;; later delete or replace a paste. Set this via the variables
;; `ix-user' and `ix-token' via M-x customize-group RET ix
;;
;; Posts (if posted with user and token) can be deleted by `ix-delete'
;; command which prompts for post id (the string after http://ix.io/)
;;
;; curl is used as the backend via grapnel http request library.
;;

;; History

;; 0.5 - Initial release.
;; 0.6 - Added delete posts functionality
;; 0.6.1 - Minor fix for `ix-delete' interactive form
